## 0.19.5

- Improve the typing system. The black magic will now output in Intellisense a much more intelligible output.

## 0.19.4

- Add an optional second parameter to `extractFindParams` to use a custom page size instead of the default 50.

## 0.19.3

- Improve the `extractFindParams` to automatically set a `last` of 50 when only `before` is available.

## 0.19.2

- Add a new `count` method on repositories, that allow to get the number of metaobjects of a given type.

## 0.19.1

- Internally rewrite how requests are made to Shopify. This change removed the dependency to Remix, and now makes the package compatible with admin extensions.

## 0.19.0

- [BC] Removing the `fieldsDifference` method from this package. After giving it another thought, I feel this does not belong to this library. This is a very easy utility method to add, so users who need that can re-add it on their project. Also, in the context of a Remix app, it is just easier to re-send the whole metaobject on updating.

## 0.18.0

- [BC] To allow support for different kind of environments (admin API, direct access, storefront API...), the `createContext` method has been replaced by three dedicated functions: `createAdminContext`, `createDirectAccessContext` and `createStorefrontApiContext`. You now must use the appropriate method based on the context you intent to use the library.

## 0.17.4

- Improve the serialization of boolean. You can now properly pass boolean as boolean, and the library will automatically convert them to string.

## 0.17.3

- After further consideration, rich text metafields are returned as it is, instead of being converted to HTML. This makes it safer when you want to feed the JSON to a rich text editor.

## 0.17.2

- Rich text metafield are converted to HTML automatically.

## 0.17.1

- Fix a bug where the `onPopulate` callback was not properly called for metafield without definition.
- Ensure that enums are converted to types to make it easier to use.

## 0.17.0

- [BC] After performance testing, including capabilities and thumbnails (especially on list) can be quite costly. When fetching your own metaobjects,
this is now disabled by default. You must use the new `includeCapabilities` and `includeThumbnail` to get them.
- Metafields JSON values are now camelCased when retrieved, and snake_case before being saved.
- Metafields referencing metaobjects are now serialized as per the schema.

## 0.16.1

- Ensure the direct access set the same API version.

## 0.16.0

- Added a new `metafieldDefinitionManager`. Similar to the `metaobjectDefinitionManager`, it allows to create metafield definitions automatically.
- Added a new `deleteDefinition` on the `metaobjectDefinitionManager`.
- Improve the `getAppMetafield`, `getMetafield`, `getMetafields` and `getMetafield` to fetch reference.
- The `createDefinition` method on the manager will now throw a `DefinitionTakenException` if the definition already exists, allowing to more easily categorize errors.
- Added support for direct access.
- [BC] Rename the `definitionManager`, `DefinitionManager` and `DefinitionRepository` to `metaobjectDefinitionManager`, `MetaobjectDefinitionManager` and `MetaobjectDefinitionRepository`, respectively.
- [BC] Rename the `DefinitionSchema` type to `MetaobjectDefinitionSchema`.
- [BC] I'm reverting the changes done in 0.13.0 and merge back again all methods from the metaobject definition repository back to the metaobject definition manager. Splitting into two made the usage more confusing than needed.

## 0.15.1

- Remove the `createdAt` from metaobjects and metaobject definitions. This field is currently only available in the `unstable` API version. To allow merchants using the library, it has been removed. It will be re-added once we version this library.

## 0.15.0

- Added a new `getMetafield` method to get a single metafield of a given resource.
- Fixed an incorrect typing for `getAppMetafields` and `getMetafields`.

## 0.14.0

- Added a new `fieldsDifference` to calculate the difference between two set of fields. This is useful to perform optimized metaobject updates.

## 0.13.4

- Fixed an issue where list of file references were not properly populated.

## 0.13.3

- Improved typing for all file references to reflect what is being pulled by default.

## 0.13.2

- Streamline the returned fields for file references, to ensure all types include the preview image.

## 0.13.1

- Add a new `getAppMetafields` to get multiple app-owned metafields in one call.

## 0.13.0

- [BC] The `definitionManager` has been splitted into two classes: the `DefinitionRepository` that allows to find, update or create definition, and the `DefinitionManager`, which is a higher level abstraction that create automatically all definitions from a schema. In the future, we plan to add more utilities such as `syncFromSchema`, so this allows to better split the concerns. Method names have also been updated to `findByType`, `findByTypeOrFail`, `create` and `update`, to align with the metaobject repository methods.
- [BC] The `getExistingTokens` on the storefront token repository has been renamed to `findExistingTokens` to better align with other naming.

- After a lot of breaking changes, I feel the library is now stable enough. I plan to tag a version 1.0.0 in the coming weeks.

## 0.12.2

- Fixed an incorrect mapping (`MediaImage` instead of `Image`).

## 0.12.1

- Add the `fileStatus` field when retrieving a file reference, as this is useful to check if a file has been processed or not.

## 0.12.0

- [BC] We're removing the `createFormState`, and replace it by a simpler `flattenFields` function that flatten a nested structure. After using it, I've realized that this abstraction is not really correct and it should not be the responsability of this library to work create form state. Instead, it just offers a utility to flatten the fields. For instance:

```ts
const event = await eventRepository.findById('123', { populate: ['image' ]});

// event.system <= contains ID, handle...
// event.image <= contains an image hash with the src, height, width...

const flattenFields = flattenFields(event);

// Will return a new object that excludes system elements, and where relationships are converted to ID:
// { image: "gid://shopify/Image/345" }
```

I've introduced many breaking changes at a fast pace, but I feel that I am finally getting a nice API, and I'm heading releasing a first stable release in a few weeks.

## 0.11.0

- [BC] The `createFormState` now returns the fields under the `fields` key. This better separate actual fields from system data (such as id or handle) and allows more logical validations, avoid clash namings (you can now have a field named `id` that it won't cause problem).

Before:
```ts
const formState = createFormState(object);

// You could access fields using the key:
formState.name;
```

After:
```ts
const { id, handle, fields } = createFormState(object);

// You could access fields using the key:
fields.name;

## 0.10.2

- Fix deserialization of JSON type fields. Their content are now properly converted to camelCase (to make it consistent to use in JS).
- Fix deserialization to convert boolean (which are internally stored as a string in Shopify) to a boolean, to make it easier to use.

## 0.10.0/0.10.1

- [BC] The `getDefinitionByType` now throws a `NotFoundException` exception if the definition does not exist, instead of returning null.
- Added two new `findByIdOrFail` and `findByHandleOrFail` on the metaobject repository.

## 0.9.0

- [BC] I have removed the function `getEmptyObject` from the repository. After testing it, I felt it was an incorrect abstraction. The `getEmptyObject` was basically just used to generate an empty object with everything to null, whose only goal was to then convert it to a form state by using the `createFormState`. This, indirectly, couples the repository with a UI concern (generating a form state). A better solution is to actually manually creating your form state explicitly:

Before:
```ts
// in the loader
const event = eventRepository.getEmptyObject();
const formState = createFormState(event);
```

After:
```ts
// in the loader
const formState: createFormState<InferObjectType<typeof eventRepository>>({ fields: { foo: 'Bar' }});
```

The main difference is that you must explicitly pass the fields. Another (and safer) option, is to use a validation library like `zod`, and re-use the schema to generate an empty form state.

```ts
// in the loader
const formState: eventCreateSchema.parse({});
```

- Adding a new `InferObjectType` utility type, allowing to generate a type with a populated map. You can use it either with the definitions and an explicit type, or by using a repository:

```ts
// With a definitions
const { definitions } from 'your-definitions';
type Event = InferObjectType<typeof definitions, '$app:event', ['image']>;

// With a repository
type Event = InferObjectType<typeof eventRepository, ['image']>;
```

- Further improve the typing of the `createFormState` to handle more edge cases.

## 0.8.6

- Typing for `getEmptyObject` has been improved: it now takes into account defaultValues and properly type the values that have been explicitly set.
- Typing for `createFormState` has been improved: when using references or list of references, the form state will now be properly typed with strings (reference IDs).

## 0.8.5

- Typing for JSON fields with a validation schema is now honored for create, update, upsert and getEmptyObject.

## 0.8.4

- Further improve typing of `getEmptyObject`.

## 0.8.3

- The `getEmptyObject` now has an optional `defaultValues` option.
- The typing system has been improved for the `createFormState`. Now, 

## 0.8.1/0.8.2

- Make the default publishable of new metaobjects as active.

## 0.8.0

- [BC] The `getEmptyObject` will now have a `system` with all the possible keys set to null.
- The `getEmptyObject` now accepts an optional `defaultPublishableStatus`.
- Ensure that JSON fields are returned as an object when using the `createFormState` method, and are not serialized as a string.

## 0.7.0

- [BC] The `createFormState` method has been changed: id and handle now returns an empty string instead of null, to ensure it aligns with other properties, and make it easier to use for forms.
- Typing has been improved for capabilities. The `system.capabilities` in the returned objects will now match the definition. For instance, if a definition does not contain the `publishable` capability, it won't appear in the metaobject generated type anymore.

## 0.6.0

- The `createDefinition` method is now public on the definitions manager, to allow developers to create custom definition that are not baked by a schema.
- The `getDefinitionByType` method has been added to the definitions manager.

## 0.5.1

- Ensure the typing for JSON also works for arrays.

## 0.5.0

- JSON fields are now also converted to camelCase, to make the experience most consistent in JavaScript (and then converted back to snake_case when saved to Shopify).
- Improved the typing to add support for JSON fields.

## 0.4.1/0.4.2

- Improve the typing system on definition to ensure that `list.boolean`, `list.rich_text_field`, `list.money`, `list.id`, `list.json` and `list.multi_line_text_field` are not accepted.

## 0.4.0

- Added a new `extractFindParams` utility function that can be used to automatically extract search params to be used with the `find` method.

## 0.3.5/0.3.6

- Fix a bug where the id was not properly converted to GID when using legacy ID in the `update` method.

## 0.3.3/0.3.4

- I'm not 100% sure on what would be the best way to handle that, but actually I am changing the null values again: list fields will actually default to [] when returned, while scalar value will resolve to null (as per the change introduced in 0.3.2).

## 0.3.2

- Change the logic of how null values are treated to match Shopify structure, and improve the typing so that non required fields might resolve to null in the generated type.

## 0.3.1

- Fix an issue during deserialization for an empty reference.

## 0.3.0

- A new `getEmptyObject` method has been added on repositories, which allows creating an empty object for creating forms, while preserving all the typing system.
- A new `createFormState` method has been added to make it easier to work with forms.
- [BC] Null values are now deserialized as string (for non-list fields) and as empty array for list fields. This makes it easier to work with forms.
- [BC] The `system` is now marked as read-only, as it should not be edited.

## 0.2.5

- Fix an inference data for the `CreateInput`, `UpsertInput` and `UpdateInput` on list fields.

## 0.2.4

- Fix an issue in the definition manager dependency creation.

## 0.2.3

- Fix invalid build.

## 0.2.2

- Fix serialization of fields for `createMany`.

## 0.2.1

- Fix serialization of fields.

## 0.2.0

- Add a store access token repositories.

## 0.1.2

- Add a new `setAppMetafields` function to the metafield repository to make it easier to save app metafields without manually retrieving the current app installation ID.

## 0.1.1

- Add the missing `withClient` in metafield repository.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
